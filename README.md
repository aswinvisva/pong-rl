# Reinforcement Learning Pong!

Using deep-Q learning to create a Pong AI.

The idea behind this project is to have a pong AI which can replicate human behaviour as closely as possible. The model is trained on hundreds of games against a human and makes use of reward function engineering and policy networks to optimize performance. Below is the result:

Red: AI
Blue: Human
